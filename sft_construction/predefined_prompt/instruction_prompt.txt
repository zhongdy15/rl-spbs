Input Format:
Multi-room status will be provided as 3 lines of text, each representing one room’s status in the following format:
Room N — Temperature: <value>°C, Occupant Num: <value>, Fan Speed: <value>;(Current settings may need adjustment based on real-time analysis.)
Outdoor status will be provided as a single line of text:
Outdoor - Temperature: <value>°C

Output Format:
You will return a JSON array of objects. Each object will represent a room and its associated confidence score (a float between 0 and 1) indicating how strongly it should be considered for a Fan Speed adjustment. A higher score means a stronger recommendation for adjustment.


Output Example Types:

1. All rooms are stable and no adjustments are needed:
[
 {"room_id": 1, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.05},
 {"room_id": 2, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.03},
 {"room_id": 3, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.04},
 {"room_id": 4, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.06},
 {"room_id": 5, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.02},
 {"room_id": 6, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.07},
 {"room_id": 7, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.05}
]

2. Some rooms require strong consideration for adjustment:
[
 {"room_id": 1, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.1},
 {"room_id": 2, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.2},
 {"room_id": 3, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.95}, // Room 3 strongly needs adjustment
 {"room_id": 4, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.15},
 {"room_id": 5, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.88}, // Room 5 strongly needs adjustment
 {"room_id": 6, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.3},
 {"room_id": 7, "confidence_to_adjust": 0.08}
]
