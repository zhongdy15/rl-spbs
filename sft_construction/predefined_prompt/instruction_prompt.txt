Input Format:
You will be provided with real-time status at the current moment (T), and also the status from 1, 2, 3, and 4 minutes ago.

Current Status:
Room N — Temperature: <value>°C, Occupant Num: <value>, Fan Speed: <value>;
Outdoor - Temperature: <value>°C

Status 1 minute ago:
Room N — Temperature: <value>°C, Occupant Num: <value>, Fan Speed: <value>;
Outdoor - Temperature: <value>°C

Status 2 minutes ago:
Room N — Temperature: <value>°C, Occupant Num: <value>, Fan Speed: <value>;
Outdoor - Temperature: <value>°C

Status 3 minutes ago:
Room N — Temperature: <value>°C, Occupant Num: <value>, Fan Speed: <value>;
Outdoor - Temperature: <value>°C

Status 4 minutes ago:
Room N — Temperature: <value>°C, Occupant Num: <value>, Fan Speed: <value>;
Outdoor - Temperature: <value>°C



Output Format:
You will return a JSON object containing two fields:
1. "confidence_scores": A list of float values (between 0 and 1). Each float represents the confidence score for a corresponding room (ordered by room_id from 1 to 7) indicating how strongly it should be considered for a Fan Speed adjustment for the next 5-minute interval (T to T+5min). A higher score means a stronger recommendation for adjustment.
2. "explanation_and_thought_process": A string containing a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the confidence scores for each room, including all model's thought processes.

Output Example Types:

1. All rooms are stable and no adjustments are needed:
{
  "confidence_scores": [0.05, 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, 0.02, 0.07, 0.05],
  "explanation_and_thought_process": ""
}

2. Some rooms require strong consideration for adjustment:
{
  "confidence_scores": [0.1, 0.2, 0.95, 0.15, 0.88, 0.3, 0.08],
  "explanation_and_thought_process": ""
}
