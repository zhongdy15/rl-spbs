The recommendation will be used in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to optimize Fan Speed settings.\n\nKey points to consider:\n- Occupant Comfort: Maintain an optimal temperature range of 25-27°C.\n- Energy Efficiency: Ensure the cooling process maintains energy efficiency by preventing excessive Fan Speed adjustments. Focus on finding the balance between optimal temperature and minimal energy use.\n- Temperature & Fan Speed Relationship: A higher Fan Speed results in stronger cooling, reducing room temperature. Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\n\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices. Changes affect only the specific room.\n  - Rooms 5-7 (Large interconnected hall): Changes to one of these rooms affect the others due to air mixing, so any adjustment should consider the collective impact.\n\n\n",

The recommendation will be used in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to optimize Fan Speed settings.\n\nKey points to consider:\n- Occupant Comfort: Maintain an optimal temperature range of 25-27°C.\n- Energy Efficiency: Ensure the cooling process maintains energy efficiency by preventing excessive Fan Speed adjustments. Focus on finding the balance between optimal temperature and minimal energy use.\n- Temperature & Fan Speed Relationship: A higher Fan Speed results in stronger cooling, reducing room temperature. Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\n\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices. Changes affect only the specific room.\n  - Rooms 5-7 (Large interconnected hall): Changes to one of these rooms affect the others due to air mixing, so any adjustment should consider the collective impact.\n\n\n",

The recommendation will be used in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to optimize Fan Speed settings.\n\nKey points to consider:\n- Occupant Comfort: Maintain an optimal temperature range of 25-27°C.\n- Energy Efficiency: Ensure the cooling process maintains energy efficiency by preventing excessive Fan Speed adjustments. Focus on finding the balance between optimal temperature and minimal energy use.\n- Temperature & Fan Speed Relationship: A higher Fan Speed results in stronger cooling, reducing room temperature. Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\n\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices. Changes affect only the specific room.\n  - Rooms 5-7 (Large interconnected hall): Changes to one of these rooms affect the others due to air mixing, so any adjustment should consider the collective impact.\n\n\n",

The recommendation will be used in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to optimize Fan Speed settings.\n\nKey points to consider:\n- Occupant Comfort: Maintain an optimal temperature range of 25-27°C.\n- Energy Efficiency: Ensure the cooling process maintains energy efficiency by preventing excessive Fan Speed adjustments. Focus on finding the balance between optimal temperature and minimal energy use.\n- Temperature & Fan Speed Relationship: A higher Fan Speed results in stronger cooling, reducing room temperature. Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\n\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices. Changes affect only the specific room.\n  - Rooms 5-7 (Large interconnected hall): Changes to one of these rooms affect the others due to air mixing, so any adjustment should consider the collective impact.\n\n\n",

The recommendation will be used in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to optimize Fan Speed settings.\n\nKey points to consider:\n- Occupant Comfort: Maintain an optimal temperature range of 25-27°C.\n- Energy Efficiency: Ensure the cooling process maintains energy efficiency by preventing excessive Fan Speed adjustments. Focus on finding the balance between optimal temperature and minimal energy use.\n- Temperature & Fan Speed Relationship: A higher Fan Speed results in stronger cooling, reducing room temperature. Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\n\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices. Changes affect only the specific room.\n  - Rooms 5-7 (Large interconnected hall): Changes to one of these rooms affect the others due to air mixing, so any adjustment should consider the collective impact.\n\n\n",

The recommendation will be used in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to optimize Fan Speed settings.\n\nKey points to consider:\n- Occupant Comfort: Maintain an optimal temperature range of 25-27°C.\n- Energy Efficiency: Ensure the cooling process maintains energy efficiency by preventing excessive Fan Speed adjustments. Focus on finding the balance between optimal temperature and minimal energy use.\n- Temperature & Fan Speed Relationship: A higher Fan Speed results in stronger cooling, reducing room temperature. Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\n\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices. Changes affect only the specific room.\n  - Rooms 5-7 (Large interconnected hall): Changes to one of these rooms affect the others due to air mixing, so any adjustment should consider the collective impact.\n\n\n",

Fan Speed of 0 means the fan is off.\n\nScenario Settings:\n- Season: Summer (Cooling mode).\n- Effect of FCU Fan Speed:\n  - 0: Fan Off (no cooling).\n  - 1: Low speed (minimal cooling, may be insufficient in high-occupancy rooms.).\n  - 2: Medium speed (moderate cooling).\n  - 3: High speed (maximum cooling, rapid temperature reduction).\n\nBuilding Configuration:\n- 7 rooms in total.\n  - Rooms 1-4: Independent offices. Changes affect only the specific room.\n  - Rooms 5-7 (Large interconnected hall): Changes to one of these rooms affect the others due to air mixing, so any adjustment should consider the collective impact.\n\n\n",
